                    <p> I met them at a home buying seminar that was focused on the {neighborhood }area. I was impressed with their level of knowledge and the amount of data that they had about the market. It was a no-brainer for me to work with them since I was set on buying in {neighborhood} and I’m so thankful I did best store everrrr ❤❤❤.</p><br>

                  <p> was ALWAYS available for home tours. Their responsiveness was incredible. If they didn’t pick up, they always call back no longer than 5 minutes later. Seriously. I purchased a newly constructed condo so it wasn’t a straightforward deal. They told me that going in and highlighted the concerns they had and the research they wanted to do to make sure progress was being made and I wouldn’t have to wait for a long time to move in.  veryy nice service💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜.</p><br>

                <p> I’m one of the first of my friend group to buy a house, so there were no – “well what do you think” or “what feedback did you have in your experience” talks – except with {Agent Name}. And that’s not in their job description, and it truly makes me consider them not just an agent, but a friend. Overall, I would strongly recommend {Agent Name} to anyone looking to buy or sell a home, especially if they are first-time homebuyers. I would trust them with my eyes closed and their attention to detail and level of time/dedication to their clients is outstanding. It is what I expected 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚.</p><br>

              <p>They were up with us working on our offer into the early morning hours. They helped us figure out the best way to position our offer and what price to go in at to give us the absolute best chance that the sellers would accept our offer over the other one. 

                We felt like we were working with our best friend rather than a real estate agent. The experience was really really good 🤩🤩🤩🤩.</p><br>

            <p> We loooooved working with {QGML} ❤! We’re a young family with a 1-year-old toddler and we really needed to upgrade from our 1 bedroom rental to our first home which we envisioned to have 3 bedrooms. IN JUST 3 WEEKS {QGML} helped us score a move-in ready condo with 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, 14 feet high ceilings, 2 garage spaces, balconies, and a deck with dream views in a prime location just a few minutes walk from 24th BART station. I really appreciated how {QGML} went above and beyond to help us during every stage of the process: They frequently sent us great matches for what we were looking for. They would accompany us to see the places and, since they are so experienced, they would point out subtle things that we would have missed but were really important for our decision process. I love that they also helped me with the emotional toll of buying a place in San Francisco: Every time I would have little anxiety attacks, they would be there for me and have the right words to calm me down. They were soooo patient!Love the trendy cozy style !🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰</p><br>

                    <p>Another huge perk about {QGML} is that they are also a real estate lawyer and knows the field extremely well. They were able to support us during the stressful mortgage process, were an indispensable line of communication with the bank, and helped us get an unheard-of interest rate, especially considering we are first-time buyers. Their advocacy moved mountains! We consider ourselves extremely lucky and blessed to have had them as our Realtor! I would rate them higher than 10 if I could! We will eternally be grateful that they helped us find our beautiful home. Great prices 💙💙💙💙💙.</p><br>
